<h2>~Directions~</h2>
<li>In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the tomatoes, large slice of onion, garlic cloves, 
  and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the 
  flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl, or pan. 
  Discard any stuff left over in the food mill. </li>
<li>In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a 
  roux, cooking until the roux is a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, 
  so that no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and adjust to taste.</li>
