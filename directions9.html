<h2>~Directions~</h2>
<li>Place potatoes, carrots, celery, and onion into a large skillet; 
  pour in clam juice and add enough water to cover. Cook and stir over 
  medium-low heat until vegetables are tender. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large, heavy saucepan over medium heat. 
  Whisk in flour until smooth. Whisk in cream and stir constantly until 
  thick and smooth. Stir in vegetable mixture with any juices until just 
  heated through.</li>
<li>Stir in clams just before serving. If they cook too much they get 
  tough. When clams are heated through, stir in vinegar and season with 
  salt and pepper. </li>
