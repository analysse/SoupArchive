<h2>~Directions~</h2>
<li>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, 
  until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off 
  all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</li>
<li>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, 
  about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, 
  and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken 
  stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
<li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 
  1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, 
  stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine. </li>
<li>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and puree. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
